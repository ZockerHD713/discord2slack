## How does one create Discord and Slack bots?

3. When the app is created, click on "Create a Bot User"
4. Name bot, copy the Token + Client ID, paste them in the conf. section of the source code and save changes.
5. Go here (but replace "YOUR_CLIENT_ID" in the URL) [https://discordapp.com/oauth2/authorize?client_id=YOUR_CLIENT_ID_HERE&scope=bot&permissions=3072](https://discordapp.com/oauth2/authorize?client_id=YOUR_CLIENT_ID_HERE&scope=bot&permissions=3072)
6. Choose the server you want to give your bot access to and click OK (or wtv the submit button is named)
